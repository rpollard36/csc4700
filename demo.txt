What is your favorite movie?
My favorite movie is Bridesmaids.

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
If I could go anywhere, I would go to Austrailia.  I have always wanted to visit Austrailia because I have family there, and I think it's extremely beautiful!

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
If I could have any super power, I would choose to fly because I'm very impatient, and I think flying would help that.
